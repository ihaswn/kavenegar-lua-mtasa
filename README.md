## About

This project is a Lua wrapper for the Kavenegar API that supports sending SMS, voice calls, and other features with event-based callbacks.

It is inspired by the official [Kavenegar PHP API](https://github.com/kavenegar/kavenegar-php/tree/master) implementation.

For detailed information on Kavenegarâ€™s REST API, please refer to the official documentation:  
[Kavenegar REST API Documentation](https://kavenegar.com/rest.html)

Stay tuned for detailed documentation!
